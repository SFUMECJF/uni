## Teamwork

* We built upon our teamwork methodology from iterations 1 and 2 and improved on what we thought did not work as well in those iterations. Our general procedure for assigning and completing tasks remained the same in that we still emphasised the use of agile practices, including stand-ups, task boards, pair/group programming, code reviews and test-driven development. 


* After iteration 2, we decided on a few dates to meet(either online or in-person) so that we could ensure every person could attend the meeting. This was set at 1-2 times per week, increasing closer towards the due date so we could have any queries resolved before submission. We thought that 1-2 times per week was sufficient for now as we could quickly contact each other online without a group meeting. We decided that stand-ups were essential in group meetings as they allowed us to see what the main difficulties are in the project, the stage we are up to in the project and also allowed everyone to be on the same page.

* On Tuesday 29th October, we conducted our first meeting. With iteration 2 fresh in our mind, we could easily communicate what we think we needed to change in our project according to the draft specification for iteration 3. We decided on things we needed to refactor, in particular modifying our code to include classes, as well as changing our initial tests. After this meeting, we set the task-board accordingly and decided on the next group meeting date so we could refactor the code together.

* On Thursday 31st October, we had an in-person group meeting so we could initiate our code refactoring together. It was important that we conducted this together so everyone could be on the same page when we started on changing other parts of the project, including testing. After everyone was briefed on how refactoring was to be done, we assigned tasks to be done before the next meeting, which would be online. We created a collaborative document to initiate the markdown file for refactoring.

* On Sunday 3rd November, we had an online meeting and stand-up, discussing our initial progress on code refactoring and what difficulties we had with it. As some of our group members were not confident with classes and playing around with the project code on such a big scale, not much progress was made in modifying the code. As a result, we ended behind on schedule, and had to reassign tasks to group members with new deadlines. However, this also meant some individuals had to increase their workload to make up for the lost time in our initial plan. Our team encouraged each other to speak up whenever they were not confident in their abilities to contribute, as other members would try their best to guide them.

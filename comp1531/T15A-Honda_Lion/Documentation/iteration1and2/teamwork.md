## Teamwork

* Our team, Honda Lion, placed heavy emphasis on the use of agile practices, in-order to maximise our work efficiency, especially since we had five people rather than four which is slightly harder to manage. We utilised an array of agile practices including weekly stand-ups, task boards, pair programming and test-driven development. All of these tasks proved equally important as they allowed for swift turnovers and lighter documentation.

* Team meetings are valuable as they allow us to exchange information, plan for the future and review our past performance. Hence, we had one to two hour team meetings three times a week on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays. 

* On Tuesday 15/10, which was the first meeting for the second iteration, we attempted to clarify all misunderstandings about the second iteration and developed our team's knowledge of flask through pair sessions. These pair sessions involved pairing up members with a superior understanding of flask with members who had a limited understanding of flask. This practice aimed to ensure that all members had more of an equal level of coding proficiency and boosted our team members' confidence and morale. At the end of our session we assigned tasks using Gitlab's dashboard and set a deadline for the next time we met, which was Friday 18/10. By doing so, we ensured that each member was aware of their task and able to prioritise assigned functions. Gitlab's intuitive dashboard allowed us to better document our workflow and gave us better insight on the prioritised tasks in a simple and concise way. Furthermore, we assigned tasks in a manner whereby each individual took a portion of a particular tasks, allowing for greater familiarity with the code overall and better understanding of the following functions that were to be implemented. 

* On Friday 18/10, we decided to meet in person as it was proven to be more efficient in iteration 1. We looked over each others assigned tasks and as a group, helped individuals with tasks that they were unsure of. This also strengthened our group understanding of the specification for iteration 2 as a whole, as individuals who understood parts of the spec more than others explained how they viewed it. We decided that to ensure our backend would fully meet the specifications and our user stories, we would need to complete the assurance file as a team before Sunday. This resulted in a Google Docs being created and worked on in everyone's own time. At the end of the meeting, we agreed to meet online on Sunday to see how we progressed.

* On Sunday 20/10 we held a stand-up, where each individual discussed how much of their assigned tasks had been completed, what they struggled with and how they will they fix their issues. We also completed our assurance documentation so that we would have no doubts when implementing our following functions in the backend. After having our stand-up, we had a group code review session for the individuals who felt like they struggled the most during their assigned tasks. During this group session, we aimed to get every team member on the same page, especially in terms of how members approached the tasks and their thought process. This technique of ensuring that we are advancing through the code at the same pace, and pair/group work has proved very effective as problems were solved in the span of a few days rather than a week. 

* After completing all the assigned tasks, we held a meeting on Tuesday 22/10 and assigned the remaining load of tasks to complete.  By ensuring we complete a moderate amount of code periodically, the code is of much higher quality and bugs are less prevalent. We held another peer review session, where each individual reviews everyone else's code and pointed out any possible bugs or errors. Again, this iterative form of work prepared us for our coming Friday meeting and removed any lingering doubts about the specification. Lastly since we perfected the testing code in the first iteration, we truly capitalised on Test driven development, where we covered an optimal amount of test cases and thus achieved a good amount of test coverage.  Good code coverage will ultimately ensure customer satisfaction as a minimal amount of bugs will arise when the product is launched.

* On Friday 25/10, we worked on the teamwork documentation as a team. We used Discord as our form of communication and Google Docs as our form of collaboration. We also cleaned up our assurance documentation ensuring it was ready for submission.

* Agile principles and values such as valuing customer satisfaction have encouraged us to increase our contingency and proactiveness in reading the specification and sticking closely to the user stories we created in order to appropriately assimilate them into user acceptance. As a result, we removed any possible misunderstanding that may have arose between our group and the stakeholders, and thus delivered the desired product by and before the deadline. For instance, a changelog/clarification was made 17/10/2019 by our consumer, that better explained the difference between what they believe general permissions and channel permissions should be. Our agile principles allowed us to swiftly adapt, by creating a new user story which met our client's needs.  We then proceeded to fix any errors and implement these changes in the code. Agile practices also dictate simplicity, efficiency and sustainability in the production of our product, hence we aimed to standardise our code by using Pylint, which encouraged better code syntax and layout. As a result, if any modification was required, only a small portion of the code was required to be edited, and this limited the possibility of breaking other functions.

* Agile practices and workflow can only succeed if each member of the group is motivated, passionate and skilled to complete their role. Our team composition involved everyone in coding and documentation writing from the very first iteration. As a result, everyone gradually built up their coding skills to a high and similar degree, allowing for smooth completion of code. Furthermore, by having each person contribute to the documentation each individual is aware of the consumer wants and desires, and to that affect the number of misunderstandings will be minimised. Each member also came to understand their strengths and weaknesses as well as their team members and thus compensated for each other. For instance, data storage for our backend involved a simple global variable. Although the choice of using CSVs and SQL were available, we avoided them since most of our members were unfamiliar on how to utilise them. By doing so, the time that we would have been wasted learning these tools was used to further improve and enhance our code.

* Thus, agile practices ensured a high level of code, in the shortest possible time and as efficiently as possible, while still allowing the code to be bug free, sustainable and easily adjustable for new client demands. Most importantly, a close relationship was maintained, and old user stories were modified to ensure user acceptance.

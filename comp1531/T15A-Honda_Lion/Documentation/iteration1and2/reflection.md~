* As a team: User stories (each group member writes 6-7 user stories), assumptions, plan and reflection

## Team work

* We have 2 group meetings each week, one is Tuesday 6pm after our lab and another one is online on Sunday(we held it on Friday this week as iteration 1 will be due on Sunday).

* In the group meetings, each team member will talk about their ideas, how they progressed and the difficulties they encountered. Through this method, we could collectively work through the problems and stay on the same wavelength whilst brainstorming.

* In the first meeting, we set up the local repository together and looked through the specifications on the project page.

* In the second meeting, we did the planning together. Some members suggested that we separate all functions into one file and all tests in another file. But at the end of the meeting, we recognised that it would result in messy code.

* In the third meeting, we distributed tasks to each group members. As stated above, we decided to separate the project into 5 classes for various reasons. Firstly, it was much easier to start, as the project was split into 5 smaller tasks which the team could take on one at a time. However, we decided it would be more efficient if we divided the 5 tasks to each of the group members. Any assistance on pytests or additional thoughts on assumptions that should be made were brought up during meetings and/or through online communication.

* During the fourth meeting, we talked about planning and reflection. We decided the priorities of implementing the functions and did research on how to write a server and graphical user interface.

* Most of the time we messaged each other on facebook chat as normally we did not have time to meet in person except for group meetings after our lab. By using this group chat, group members helped each other and reported their progress as they continued with the project.

* We decided it was a good idea to keep bumping the chat and asking how everyone's part was coming along, to avoid one member going ahead too far or being too behind. It was also a good reminder to progress through the tasks consistenly rather than rushing through the tasks right before the due date.

* Thus, communication during this iteration went rather smoothly, though schedules of the various members varied and limited progress that could've been made earlier. This, although it 
may be something we can't improve in, can be made much more efficient by determining set times in which we all work together. This way, we can do the most work at once as efficient as 
possible while also reducing and/or removing any potential miscommuncation involved with working separately. 

* As a result of members working seperately from others at times, some miscommuncation as to how our functions and pytests were built developed. This limited efficiency and complicated 
development. Most of the issues had stemed from organisational sources such as messy and/or non-working code and although these issues were minor, steps should be made to reduce such 
misunderstandings as it is important that no larger issues are created. 

* Sometimes we did have conflicting ideas, especially regarding how to use pytest, everyone had their own idea of implementing it. But we solved this in the group meeting and reached an agreement at the end. One particular example was whether pytest should be passing all tests at the moment. Although a majority of our group said yes, we read the forum and Webcms posts, where the lecturer said that we could have failed tests since the functions are not implemented yet. Also, since we are going to be mostly marked on our test logic and coverage, we decided that some failed test cases were fine.

* It was important that our pytests were operational in this iteration but it was just as important that we had stub functions that could work in regard to returning appropriate errors.
As a result, most of our functions have been made to be at least operational in returning errors. Even though this may have been not recommended by our tutor, it was vital in enabling 
us to build thorough pytests that could be tested on deeper levels. 

* However the appropriate debugging needed to create these working functions resulted in our worktime increasing to a greater level. This, though inconvenient, outweighed its 
disadvantages as it enabled our efficient creation of pytests.

* Although we think we already did a good job in iteration 1, but as usual, there are still some improvements that we could make. We should take the time to meet each other more in person so that our meetings are more efficient as sometimes you cannot explain your idea clearly online. We also are planning to use an online voice chat such as Discord for our online meetings in the future. In the next iteration we should start earlier so that we have enough time to check for any mistakes, as we did feel a bit rushed when submitting this iteration. (in this iteration we checked mistakes through peer code review but starting earlier will always be beneficial).

* Overall, we believe as a team we performed quite well, but through more extensive communication and more frequent meetings, both online and in-person, we can improve our performance for future iterations.

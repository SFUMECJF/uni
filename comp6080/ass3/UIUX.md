# UI UX  

## Bootstrap use
Much thought was taken into consideration when UI/UX was being considered and became the main reason why the use of bootstrap was selected.  
The personal aim of this project was to create a minimum viable product as per the given spec and derived major focuses that are listed are.  
- A working product above all else  
- Simplicity  
- Ease of development  
  
Thus bootstrap was selected as the react framework for this project due to its ease of use, popularity and inherent increase in accessability.  
  

## Layout  
The layout of the app has been specified to fit both the mobile and PC, with both being tested and working well. No issues have been seen with layout when transitioning between the two and have been tested at a resolution of 400px x 700px and at 4k.  
As well as this, the basic grid layout has been selected with many generated cards fiting into this specification. All cards are layed out in grid styles with approriate spacing as well as being opacity increase animated for ux/ui intentions.  
  
A dark mode theme has also been implemented into this app as my eyes hurt when developing on white screens. Also users will have this dark mode by default which is simply the superior option when selecting light and dark themes.  
  
Many buttons have a feature that disables then during request sends, meaning that buttons cannot be overly clicked, bots cannot too easily manouver this app, and users are informed of the current loading situation.  
A topic of note as this app has been tested in throttled mode as well, with minimal differences (except for speed of server response) in user expereince.  

The use of respective labels, alts and etc have also been implemnted into the screen for accessability, as well as default fonts and general accessability quality of life features.  


## conclusion  
I believe that there has been an adequate ammount of consideration being put into this project, even though it has been extremely large in scope. I hope that the features that were implemented in time are sufficient in ensuring proper user interaction and accessability and know that I have enjoyed implementing the vast features that were required from the angel investor!

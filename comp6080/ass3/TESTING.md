# Testing
## Component testing  
All testing was done with criticality in mind meaning that components tested were selected with consideration to how vital they are within the BigBrain app 
In accordance with with this, three were selected for component testing. These were:  
- Modal  
- PlayGameScreen  
- Register  
  
By far, these components were most vital to the processes of this application and in conjunction with this, were the components that varied the most in composition.  
  

## UI Testing  
No other path was created for this happy test as it was not required for individuals to create.  
The happy path is located in the root folder in the directory ./cypress/integration/happy/happyPath.jsx  
It relies on a file existing in fixures, namely test.png which is used to add a thumbnail to the quiz itself.  
  

All work was done independantly of a partner as I was not assigned one. Many thanks!

# Usability!

## The Rundown  
Evidently, as this is a one person project, such measures such as themeing and design were kept at a minimum.  
Inclusive to this, the use of Bootstraper 5.0.0 (WITHOUT JQUERY!) was utilised as this allowed for an easier development process. 
It can purely be seen from the design that there are no overlaping or unharmonic colors as most items are based on their originals with some exceptions with buttons, images and layouts.  

### Buttons  
In total, there was a use of about 4 different buttons indicating different items as such. The most notable are  
- Red for danger and things that could cause harm
- Blue for okay  
- Grey for editing and changing states 
- Orange for updating  

With these distinct colors, I feel as though there was an appropriate amount of interpreted difference that is able to be deciphered by individuals with a high need for accessability.  

### Images  
There were not many uses of images throughout this project with exception with the post itself. In this case, alts were added to every single image generated with respect to what it was ('posted image') and who it was posted by ('by {user}).  In combination with this, there was an assurance that the size of the image was at a large scale in comparison with everything else, ensuring that the utilisation of this app, will enable a high level of accessability.  

### Layout  
This was the most obvious out of all. In combination with the buttons and images, I feel as though the layout for this app is at a good level. Some things I feel went well were  
- the font sizes themselves and the sizes of the buttons.  
- The layout of the app. Seamness and very intuitive with profile leading to your own profile and most if all buttons working  
- A high level of contrast with the black and white though not much effort was needed to change this  
- A visible font through most responsive scales from small 400px x 700px to 4k (which is what I developed this app on)  

Though there are some thigns I feel could be improved on such as the reactivity and the smoothness of the app, I feel as though the layout was achieved to an acceptable degree  

## Conclusion  
Altogether, I feel accessability and usability for this app has been done to an acceptable standard. Most if not all aspects of the app complies with most of the standards for accessibility and the UI is by no means 'confusing', although if given even more time and resources, a much higher degree of execution on this app could have been achieved.

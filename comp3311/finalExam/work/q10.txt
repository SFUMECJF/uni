# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q10

(a)
in relational notation
    fId -> from, to, distance, departs, arrives, price
    aid -> aname, range
    eid -> ename, salary
    aircraft -> aid, aname, range *
    employee -> eid, ename, salary *

(b)
    Since both aircraft and employee can lead to candidate keys and where relations * have X as not a superkey,
    a build could look like this if multiple Certifications for aircraft are needed 

    Flights(fid, from, to, distance, departs, arrives, price)
    Aircraft(aid, aname, range)
    Certifications(cid, employeeId, aircraftId)
    Employees (eid, ename, salary)

    Or, the option more in line with today's pilots (somewhat), if only one major aircraft certification is allowed for each employee

    Flights(fid, from, to, distance, departs, arrives, price)
    Aircraft(aid, aname, range)
    Certifications(cid, aircraftId)
    Employees (eid, ename, salary, certification)

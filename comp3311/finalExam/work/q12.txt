# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q12

(a)
Given the schedules and reading from left to right (reading schedule),
There a few arrows that would be drawn on a precedence graph.
They are 
T2 -> T1 on R(Y) -> W(Y)
T1 -> T2 on W(X) -> W(X)
T1 -> T3 on W(X) -> W(X)
T2 -> T3 on W(X) -> W(X)

Because we have a cycle between T1 and T2, we know that this schedule is not conflict serializable.

(b)

Since the schedule is not conflict serializable and there is a blind write in T3, it may or may not be view serializable.

Since we know the schedule, we can determine the dependencies.
T2 must occur before T1 because R(Y) must be read before W(Y).
Thus we get the dependeny T2->T1

T1 must occur after all transactions of Y due to it writing to X last and must be after all other transactions that include Y.

For X, there are no reads and with the last write being a blind write in T3

Thus, the schedule is view serializable

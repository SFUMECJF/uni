# Flat Enigma Machine
A python app based on Michael C. Koss's enigma machine found on Kevin's video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKbP3Rjxhy0) 
After seeing this machine at work in one of my security engineering courses, I decided to see how hard it would be to code.

## Getting Started
To run this app ensure that you
- have python installed and that environment values have been set to allow you turn python from a command line  
- have a terminal (like powershell) that you can run it from  

Thats it!

## Usage
To run it simply do;  

```
python enigma.py
```

or

```
python3 enigma.py
```

and follow the prompts. 

Ensure that all text requirements are met as error handling is not supported yet (the app has been very quickly put together so please excuse the tardiness).
